Siilo
=====

Siilo is a file storage abstraction layer for Python. It is inspired by
`Django's File storage API`_, but is framework agnostic.

.. _Django's File storage API:
   https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/files/storage/

Siilo supports for the following file storages:

    - :ref:`local-filesystem`
    - :ref:`apache-libcloud`
    - :ref:`amazon-s3`
    - :ref:`cmis`

Siilo has the following goals:

- to be compatible with Python's file API
- to support both Python 2 and 3
- to have full unit test coverage.

You can install the library with pip::

    pip install siilo
